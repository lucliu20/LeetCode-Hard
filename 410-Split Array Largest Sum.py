"""
Example 1:
Input: nums = [7,2,5,10,8], m = 2
Output: 18
Explanation:
There are four ways to split nums into two subarrays.
The best way is to split it into [7,2,5] and [10,8],
where the largest sum among the two subarrays is only 18.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5], m = 2
Output: 9

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,4,4], m = 3
Output: 4

nums, m = [7,2,5,10,8], 2
